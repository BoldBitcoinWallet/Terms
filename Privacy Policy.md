# Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: 18 June 2025*

**1. Introduction**

Welcome to Bold Bitcoin Wallet ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our non-custodial Bitcoin wallet application ("App").

**2. No Personal Data Collection**

Our App does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data, financial information, or private keys. All wallet data and transactions are fully managed locally on your device.

**3. No Third-Party Tracking or Analytics**

We do **not** use analytics tools, tracking services, advertising networks, or collect any user data for marketing or profiling.

**4. Local Security**

All cryptographic operations occur locally on your device. Your private keys never leave your device, and we have no access to or control over them.

**5. Interaction with Third-Party Services**

The App may connect to third-party APIs (e.g., for Bitcoin price feeds or blockchain data). We do **not** share any personally identifiable information with these services. All requests are anonymous and data flows directly between your device and these services.

**6. Data Retention**

Since no personal data is collected, we do not store or retain any user information.

**7. Browser Extension (Chrome)**

The Bold Bitcoin Wallet browser extension operates as a watch-only wallet.
The extension does not collect, transmit, or store private keys, key shares, or signing material. All transaction signing and broadcasting are performed by co-signer Bold Wallet mobile devices.
The extension may locally store non-sensitive data such as watch-only wallet information, user preferences, PIN-based privacy settings, and user-configured backend endpoints (e.g. self-hosted mempool.space instances).
No personal data is collected, sold, or shared with third parties.

**8. Changes to This Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Updates will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
